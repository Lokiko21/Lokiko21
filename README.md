- 👋 Hi, I’m @Lokiko21
- 👀 I’m interested in coding in as much different langauges as possible. I also love playing video games like modern warfare and rocket league.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to code Java. I know how to code a little bit in Python, R, HTML, and CSS although I know a little bit of each I feel
most comfortbale with HTML and CSS as I have done a couple of project websites which I feel turned out to look great!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on making some Data Analyst portfolios as I am currently looking for a job in that industry and it's been a little rough
but I wan to work on more data analysis projects and create a professional looking portfolio for job recruiters
- 📫 The best way to reach me would be through discord as I am always on my computer either doing homework for school, working on a data analysis project,
or just playing some video games with friends. My discord is Lokiko21#5772. If you'd like to email me you can at: beeanerd4ever@outlook.com just dm me bro! (or sis)
